<p>Hey {{project.author.first_name}},</p>

<p><b>Congratulations!</b></p>

<p>Your campaign <a href="http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/crowdfunding/project/{{project.id}}">{{project.title}}</a> has successfully raised Rs.{{project.get_total_pledged_amount}} against a goal of Rs.{{project.goal}}! The campaign is now closed and no more pledges will be allowed.

<p>A complete list of backers can be found on the campaign page.<br/></p>

<p>Your next task is to send a personal update to backers through the <a href="http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/crowdfunding/project/{{project.id}}/update">campaign update page</a>. Keep backers informed at all times about what you have done (images and videos can also be posted in the update section) and what your plans are.

<p>Backers will start converting their pledges into donations and we will disburse the amount to your team 14 days from the day the campaign closes.</p>

<p>Please write to us at info@thelakshyafoundation.org for any clarifications.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
